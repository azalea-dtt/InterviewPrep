Given an array of integers arrand an integer target.

You have to find two non - overlapping sub - arrays of arr each with a sum equal target.
There can be multiple answers so you have to find an answer where the sum of the lengths of the two sub - arrays is minimum.

Return the minimum sum of the lengths of the two required sub - arrays, or return -1 if you cannot find such two sub - arrays.
